comment: "Now, it's surely awesome that we completed this, AMO feels like a better
  home to lightweight themes anyhow.\r\n\r\nThat said, the dark side is that since
  lightweight themes are on AMO, downloads on full themes took a sharp dent, as
  it's almost impossible to find those now. As someone doing such a full theme add-on,
  which is a ton of work, it's a bit sad to see how people are not able to find
  it nowadays. :("

comment: Thanks Wil. Just one thing I wonder about is, why those bugs are not getting
  closed as INCOMPLETE. That feels less frustrating for people who filed the bug
  in the past. Those bugs we can always reopen, while WONTFIX gives another tone
  and doesn't visualize (at least for me) that we might want to get them fixed.

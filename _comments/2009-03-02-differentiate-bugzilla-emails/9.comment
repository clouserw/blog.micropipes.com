comment: "Being able to filter messages by custom header, such as X-Bugzilla-*,
  in my Gmail account has been a painful for me for quite a while. That's why I've
  decided to develop a Gmail application that will filter your e-mail as your desktop
  client would do:\r\nhttp://www.filtermygmail.com/\r\n\r\nAny feedback about this
  idea would be more than welcome."

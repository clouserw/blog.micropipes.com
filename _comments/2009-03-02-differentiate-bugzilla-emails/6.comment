comment: When I attempted to use gmail as a view into my bugmail (leaving Thunderbird
  2.x behind) the first thing I did was try to replicate my intricate filter system
  that is based on the custom headers in bugzilla.  And since Gmail doesn't filter
  on custom headers, I filed an issue with them.  Nothing to my knowledge ever came
  of it.  Please spam them with more bugs until they fix it. :-)

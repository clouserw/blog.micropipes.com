comment: I also have several Bugzilla accounts (Mozilla, KDE, Mandriva, RedHat,
  Songbird, ...), and I can also read the full email address of the sender, using
  GMail... from Thunderbird. ;) So this is really not a problem to me. Cannot you
  filter the email sender and redirect emails into their appropriate folder? Thunderbird
  can do that. This way, you have one folder per installation, and you aren't confused
  anymore.

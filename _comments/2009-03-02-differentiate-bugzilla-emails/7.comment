comment: Actually, KDE's Bugzilla is somewhat evil by showing the person who made
  the change in the From line of the bugmail instead of a generic bugzilla address,
  so it even confuses me in SeaMonkey/Thunderbird mail that works well enough for
  the others by showing the part after the @ as well (and I really wonder why any
  email client would be dump enough not to do that - sorry gmail).

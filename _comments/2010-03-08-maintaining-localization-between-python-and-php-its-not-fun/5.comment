comment: "I wish you luck. I had to share data between ASP.NET and PHP pages running
  on the same domain. You can't share Sessions. I passed some params and used Cookies
  but the security model breaks each time. \r\nI came to the conclusion that you
  should use one or the other. In the end jQuery and Web Services came to my aid;
  it's the best way to share this type of work."

comment: "would you like to speak out a little bit about what you are expectin the
  combination of the first two regexes to do? and how did you test, if your expectations
  are met? Thanks!\r\nOtherwise still very confusing, that a framework like cakephp
  does still not give you xss protection right out of tthe box."

comment: "Check out HTML purifier @ http://urbangiraffe.com/plugins/html-purified/\r\n\r\nIt
  is a php solution that uses whitelists, is recursive, and checks attributes as
  well as tags.  I have never used HTML purifier, but I recently wrote a Java class
  for doing this exact thing for our web application and it has passed every test
  I've thrown at it thus far.  It seems to be a pretty good solution."

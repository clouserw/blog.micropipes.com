comment: "I know this is quite an old post, but using Cake 1.2, this is still applicable.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the post. I just ran into the exact same caching issue. I don't want to know
  how much longer it would have taken me to diagnose this issue if I hadn't run
  into your post.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

comment: "I had the exact same problem as you did, and I couldn't fix it with the
  fixes you recommended above (which  makes lots of sense, looking at the Cake source
  code). \r\n\r\nIn the end I just learned to live with it, since I couldn't fix
  it. I did stuff like having little arrays to 'cache' things myself etc etc. Ugly
  stuff. But works.\r\n\r\nThat's the thing with Cake. All good, until the magic
  fails :("

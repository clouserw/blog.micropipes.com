comment: "ZFS is a great idea, but it doesn't give me the (admittedly easy to make)
  checksums files with each directory.\r\n\r\nI figured I could deal with the small
  number of warnings manually (by checking the backup vs the live file and figuring
  out which was correct).  Recursive checksumming is an interesting idea though."

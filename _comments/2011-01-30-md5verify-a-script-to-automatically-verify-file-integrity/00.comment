comment: This reminds me of Tripwire (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tripwire/)
  and rsync (with --itemize-changes --archive --link-dest). We used the former for
  file change detection and the latter for incremental backups with hard links (reporting
  new and changed files), like OS X's Time Machine does.

comment: "Hey Jesse,\r\n\r\nThis extension builds off the threads in 2.0.0.9.  When
  a new message comes in to Thunderbird it's just added to the conversation.  If
  you have a lot of mail in your inbox you might not notice it, especially if the
  conversation is old.  This extension will put the conversation with the new mail
  at the top of your inbox so it's easy to notice the new message."

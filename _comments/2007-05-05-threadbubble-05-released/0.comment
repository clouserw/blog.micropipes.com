comment: "Hi Wil,\r\n\r\nthanks for writing this extension!\r\n\r\nI was wondering
  whether you know by any chance if the \"wrong sort whithin threads bug\":\r\n\r\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=262316\r\n\r\nis
  resolved in the meantime; or how it could be resolved?\r\n\r\nI don't know how
  the patch that has been posted there can be applied (e.g. by me as a user and
  not a programmer).\r\n\r\nThank you already for your opinion,\r\nDavid.P"

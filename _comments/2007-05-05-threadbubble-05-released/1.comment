comment: "Hi David,\r\n\r\nThe patch in that bug is actually for the Thunderbird
  source code, so it's probably not something you'd want to mess with.  The good
  news is, the patch was accepted in March, so I'd expect it to be in the next release
  of Thunderbird, which is happening in the next few days."

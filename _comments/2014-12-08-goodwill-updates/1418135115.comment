comment: 'Not to put a damper on things (I do like the idea), but so far we don''t have the ability to update anything other than Marketplace apps (AFAIK). The system (gonk, gecko, gaia) is built and distributed by partners, so they''d need to be the ones producing and hosting these bits.

  It''s an interesting idea for reducing bandwidth usage, hopefully we''ll be able to make use of it someday!'

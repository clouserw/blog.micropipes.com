comment: "Now that Pootle is on Django I'm excited about the way forward.  Thanks
  go to Mozilla who've helped on this one.  I'm excited, its as if we've let Pootle
  out of a straight-jacket.  Feel free to pop in to #pootle on freenode.net for
  a chat and we'll be at FOSDEM for anyone who wants to get together for a BOF,\r\n\r\nYou
  can try the latest beta on Django from here:\r\nhttp://translate.sourceforge.net/snapshots/Pootle-1.3beta1/"

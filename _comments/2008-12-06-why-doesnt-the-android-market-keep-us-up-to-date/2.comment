comment: 'Nice to see that you are a G1 user and not an apple iphone fanboy. Even
  though the G1 supports notifications for application updates, the app that I use
  to check for updates is called: aTrackDog. It scans through all my applications
  and allows me to update apps from the developer website and not just the android
  market.'

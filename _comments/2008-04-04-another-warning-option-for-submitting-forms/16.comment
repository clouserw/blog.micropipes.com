comment: "Like Neil, I use the option to give me that second chance to consider
  if I want to submit the form or not. I'd say I end up using it at least once a
  day. Speaking of second chances, I hate blog comment forms without a Preview option.\r\n\r\nFred:
  LiveJournal uses a nonce when hashing credentials for HTTP submission to prevent
  replay attacks, I imagine other (well-designed) sites do too."

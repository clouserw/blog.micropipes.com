comment: "How about a plugin with a big \"paranoia mode\" button. Once toggled on,
  a warning (and chance to cancel) is displayed for pretty much any non-https request
  and for any request to a domain not yet approved since entering paranoia mode.\r\n\r\nSuch
  a plugin would be annoying, but very tolerable for the 1 or 2 hours a month that
  I do banking and such."

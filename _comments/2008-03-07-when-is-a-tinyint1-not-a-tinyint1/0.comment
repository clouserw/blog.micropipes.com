comment: "You gotta love that \"Automagic\". I never knew about this, so thanks
  for sharing.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm beginning to hate cake's model/ORM. Whatever
  happened to good old SQL? It's more of standard then ORM will ever be. The amount
  of code you write binding and unbinding, you could have written with one SQL statement"

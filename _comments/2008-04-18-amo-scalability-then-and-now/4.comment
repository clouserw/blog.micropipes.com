comment: Also in that history was a pair and then a triplet of Squid proxies pointing
  at a single back-end box, followed by a triplet of Apache+mod_proxy+mod_cache
  proxies sitting in front of that same box, followed by 4 webservers behind an
  LVS load balancer with each of those proxying the /developer/ subdirectory back
  to that original single box, before we had the Netscaler.

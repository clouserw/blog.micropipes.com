comment: "<blockquote>Just curious, how is this charted against the usage growth
  of AMO?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWe started using urchin on AMO about this time last
  year so I don't have numbers from before that without time consuming log crunching.
  \ I can tell you we're averaging 125M hits per day right now, and a year ago it
  was 50M."

comment: "\"With the creation of UTF-8, characters from all over the world are assigned
  numbers between 0 and 65,535.\"\r\n\r\nActually, UTF-8 can hold not just the BMP,
  but all unicode characters from 0x00 to 0x10FFFF, or numbers between 0 and 1,114,111.\r\n\r\nUCS-2
  is the encoding limited to the first 65535 chars."

comment: Well, at least the new script will keep the trash out of the stats - for
  Adblock Plus I see version numbers like "{{VERSION}}", "0.0", "0.7.5.3.beta2-compatible",
  "true", "3.0.3" etc. Those versions have never been released, that's people who
  created their own builds. On the other hand, having the usage data for development
  builds (which are not available on AMO) is useful.

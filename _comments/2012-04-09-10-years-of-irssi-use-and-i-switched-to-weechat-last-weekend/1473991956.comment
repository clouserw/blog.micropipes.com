comment: 'A really easy way to make portable Weechat configuration is by using
InWee ( https://github.com/susam/inwee ). I have been using this tool for a year
now and it makes it possible to keep all my WeeChat configuration in a single
file and pipe it into WeeChat using the command: inwee file.'

comment: "weechat's good.\r\nbut if you dont need the features and you're used to
  irssi, no biggy. irssi works well.\r\n\r\nFor example i dislike splits. I also
  dislike heavy coloring. And weird hilights and channel switches.\r\n\r\nI like
  simple and readable. Irssi delivers that. Weechat delivers it too, but, that means
  learning new commands for no gain :)"

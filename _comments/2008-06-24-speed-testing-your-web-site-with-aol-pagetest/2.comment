comment: "I would also recommend this online free tool: http://Site-Perf.com/\r\n\r\nIt
  measure loading speed of page and it's requisites (images/js/css) like browsers
  do and shows nice detailed chart - so you can easily spot bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nAlso
  very useful thing is that this tool is able to verify network quality of your
  server (packet loss level and ping delays)."

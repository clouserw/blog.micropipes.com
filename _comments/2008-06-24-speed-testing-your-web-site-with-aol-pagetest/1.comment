comment: "Sorry, we created it for IE because Firefox already has a boatload of
  useful tools and the bulk of our visitors are on IE (and trust me, Firefox gets
  plenty of use by devas the sites are being built).  We need to create a Firefox
  version at some point, it just hasn't been on the short list to do.  If someone
  wants to create an equivalent plugin for firefox I am willing to run hosted testing
  on the same equipment and offer different browsers as a test option.\r\n\r\nWhat
  wasn't presented but is also part of the source package on sourceforge (http://pagetest.sourceforge.net)
  is the automation harness that we put around pagetest for doing repetitive testing.
  \ The results are in a format suitable for databasing and trending/notifying (that
  part we haven't released as it's really not all that polished and very AOL-specific
  but if anyone wants to take on building a reporting/alarming interface I'm willing
  to help out where I can).\r\n\r\nThere's a \"Send Us Feedback\" link at the bottom
  of the webpagetest.org site that has my e-mail address if you need to reach me.\r\n\r\n-Pat"

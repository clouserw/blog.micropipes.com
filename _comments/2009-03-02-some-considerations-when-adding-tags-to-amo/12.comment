comment: 'Tags and localization is a tough beast. Untested idea: What about separating
  tags per locale. This will encourage the use of common idioms within a locale
  and not pollute the display of other locales. Additionally it may provide some
  performance benefits on the backend where character set optimizations can be made.'

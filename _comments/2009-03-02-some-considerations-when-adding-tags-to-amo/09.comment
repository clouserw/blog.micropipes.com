comment: Why make the separator a space and not a comma? In doing the tagging system
  for my personal PHP-based community system, I found it's easiest to use comma
  as a separator as it feel natural to most people (it's even the separator of lists
  of attributes in normal written language) and it easily allows for spaces withing
  tags without the workaround of quoting.

comment: "Is that a good thing?  If I have a column and I know that I always want
  numbers with a certain decimal value in it, wouldn't I want to enforce that?  What
  if you have a column that does not enforce it, am I now able to do do math on
  the values in it?\r\n\r\nI don't know much about SQLite, and this does seem like
  it could be a good feature in some settings."

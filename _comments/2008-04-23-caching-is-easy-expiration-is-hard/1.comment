comment: "One idea is the construct the key for the data you're caching in a way
  that it is the same, regardless on where you get the data from (which is often
  irrelevant as you point out). For example, an addon's uuid+\"title\" to get its
  title?\r\n\r\nAlso, instant invalidation is not necessary if you do the above,
  and make sure to overwrite the previous entry as soon as it is updated with the
  new value."

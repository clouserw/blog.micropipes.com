Accounts is turning off SyncStorage BrowserID support and it probably doesn‚Äôt
affect you at all.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2>

<p>In 2011, when Mozilla Accounts (called ‚ÄúFirefox Accounts‚Äù back then) was first
built it used BrowserID identity certificates in its authentication model.  The
BrowserID protocol never took off and Mozilla‚Äôs work on it ended in 2016.
However, the sync service in Firefox continued to use BrowserID even as OAuth
support was added to Mozilla Accounts as an alternative for all other relying
parties.</p>

<p>Over time, we recognized BrowserID was becoming a maintenance liability.  As a
non-standard protocol it created significant complexity in our codebase.
Therefore, we decided to migrate the Firefox clients off of it in favor of
OAuth.</p>

<p>This was an enormous effort, and while much more could be written about this
transition, the main takeaway is that Firefox Sync‚Äôs BrowserID support ended
with Firefox 78, which shipped in June 2020 and reached its end of life in
November 2021.</p>

<h2 id="present-day">Present day</h2>

<p>We‚Äôve been waiting a long time for the usage of Firefox 78 to drop.</p>

<p>Aside from being an <abbr title="Extended Support Release">ESR</abbr> version
there are a couple of other reasons for its extra longevity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was the last version of the browser to support Flash</li>
  <li>It was the last version of the browser to support OS X versions &lt; 10.12</li>
</ul>

<p>With Flash now largely obsolete on the web and traffic from older operating
systems becoming rarer, we‚Äôve decided that now is the appropriate time to turn
off support for this legacy protocol.</p>

<p>To avoid surprises and not leave anyone behind, we attempted to email anyone
still using that endpoint earlier this year. We didn‚Äôt receive any feedback and
we continued with the plan.</p>

<h2 id="our-method">Our method</h2>

<p>Our plan is simple:  BrowserID requests are the only traffic hitting our
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/v1/certificate/sign</code> endpoint.  We‚Äôll begin returning <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTTP 404</code> replies to a
small percentage of traffic from that endpoint and monitor for any issues.
Our testing showed no concerns but it‚Äôs challenging to be comprehensive with so
many combinations of browser versions and operating systems.  Over the next few
weeks we‚Äôll continue to ramp up the percentage of 404s until we can remove the
endpoint completely and let the traffic bounce off the front-end like any other
404.</p>

<h2 id="current-status">Current status</h2>

<p>Surprise!  I‚Äôm a few weeks late with this post.  We started returning 404s on
May 1 and are currently up to ~66% of traffic on that endpoint.  So far there
haven‚Äôt been any unexpected complications.  We‚Äôll continue to increase over the
next few weeks and aim to have all the code removed this summer.</p>]]></content><author><name>Wil Clouser</name></author><category term="Mozilla" /><category term="software" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The tl;dr here is that Mozilla Accounts is turning off SyncStorage BrowserID support and it probably doesn‚Äôt affect you at all.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I made a new hack poster</title><link href="http://192.168.10.201:4000/2024/05/03/I-made-a-new-hack-poster/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I made a new hack poster" /><published>2024-05-03T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-05-03T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://192.168.10.201:4000/2024/05/03/I-made-a-new-hack-poster</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://192.168.10.201:4000/2024/05/03/I-made-a-new-hack-poster/"><![CDATA[<p>I was feeling nostalgic a couple months ago and built a hack poster out of

I‚Äôm posting anyway because it‚Äôs ok to fail. :)</em></p>

<p>Last weekend I was inspired by <a href="http://www.twobraids.com/2018/02/lars-and-real-internet-of-things-part-1.html">Lars‚Äôs posts on IoT</a> to try <a href="https://iot.mozilla.org/gateway/">Mozilla‚Äôs Things
Gateway</a>.</p>

<p>I have an old Raspberry Pi 1 Model B with a <a href="https://razberry.z-wave.me/">RaZberry Z-Wave Daughterboard</a>
which I had soldered a larger external antenna on to last year.  I used to run
OpenHAB on it to control some z-wave devices before I moved last year and since
then it‚Äôs just been in a box.  Let‚Äôs fire it up!</p>

<p>This original Raspberry Pi is a single core 700mhz CPU, so I‚Äôm planning on
running it headless and doing everything remotely over SSH to save on GUI
resources.</p>

<p><img style="border:1px solid #aaa;" src="/assets/img/2018.raspberry.pi.1.jpg" /></p>

<p>Firstly, since I hadn‚Äôt plugged this in forever, I booted it up, uninstalled
OpenHAB and the RaZberry software and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspbian-stretch/">upgraded Raspbian to the latest
version</a>.  It‚Äôs still as
easy as it should be, just edit the sources.list and:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># apt-get update</span>
<span class="c"># apt-get dist-upgrade</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I left the upgrade running over night because it was taking so long ‚Äì a
foreshadowing of things to come! üò©</p>

<p>On the suggestion of the page I linked to above, I removed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pulseaudio</code> since I
don‚Äôt use it.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># sudo apt-get purge "pulseaudio*"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla-iot/gateway/blob/master/README.md">The instructions for installing the Gateway</a> are great and easy to follow.</p>

<p>I installed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvm</code> as recommended, although so far I‚Äôm regretting it.  It takes
12 seconds to start a new login shell now while nvm executes the stuff it put
in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code>.  If I end up logging in very often I‚Äôll get rid of it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Node world does do permissions well.  Most tools can
install in a users home directory without any root permissions, which I was
happy to do:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>curl <span class="nt">-o-</span> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash
<span class="nv">$ </span>nvm <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">--lts</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>nvm use <span class="nt">--lts</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>npm <span class="nt">--version</span>
5.6.0
<span class="nv">$ </span>node <span class="nt">--version</span>
v8.9.4
<span class="nv">$ </span>npm <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">--global</span> yarn
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next up was OpenZWave.  Their documentation mentions supporting the Razberry
card, so I felt good about things working.  When you get to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make</code> command,
go grab some lunch ‚Äì this also took plenty of time.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave.git
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>open-zwave
<span class="nv">$ </span>make <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">sudo </span>make <span class="nb">install</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>ldconfig
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, I‚Äôm ready to install the Things Gateway.  For a project that is still
new and moving quickly I like to install directly out of Git which makes
testing patches and upgrading to new versions easy (I hope!).</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/mozilla-iot/gateway.git
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>gateway
<span class="nv">$ </span>yarn  <span class="c"># Yarn actually prints how long it takes to execute.  This took 6070.32 seconds! üí§</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I don‚Äôt want to use Mozilla‚Äôs tunneling service, so I faked some SSL:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> ssl
<span class="nv">$ </span>openssl genrsa <span class="nt">-out</span> ssl/privatekey.pem 2048
<span class="nv">$ </span>openssl req <span class="nt">-new</span> <span class="nt">-sha256</span> <span class="nt">-key</span> ssl/privatekey.pem <span class="nt">-out</span> ssl/csr.pem
<span class="nv">$ </span>openssl x509 <span class="nt">-req</span> <span class="nt">-in</span> ssl/csr.pem <span class="nt">-signkey</span> ssl/privatekey.pem <span class="nt">-out</span> ssl/certificate.pem
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then start the web server.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>npm start  <span class="c"># This takes around 4 minutes to finish starting :(</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Loading the site in my browser works!   I click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">settings</code> -&gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add-ons</code> and
install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z-wave device support</code>.  However, watching the console I can see it
fail to find the z-wave interface.</p>

<p>I dug around in the code and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-iot/zwave-adapter/blob/master/zwave-adapter.js#L368">found the findZWavePort() code</a> that does the
detection, and confrimed that it‚Äôs looking at USB ports which won‚Äôt work for
the Razberry which comes in on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/ttyAMA0</code>.</p>

<div class="aside">
<p>I'm just going to stick in a little aside here...</p>

<p>I modified the <code>zwave-adapter.js</code> file to add some logging and
make sure that was as far as it was getting and restarted the server (which,
took 4 minutes...) and then saw the module failed to load because the checksum
didn't match.  I deleted the checksum file (4 minutes...), and it failed again,
so I finally just removed the one line from the checksum file.</p>

<p>The checksum is a great idea and I assume there is some kind of flag I can pass
to the server to ignore it, but I haven't found it yet.</p>
</div>

<p>One last thing I wanted to verify before I dug too far into the Gateway was to
make sure OpenZWave was working.  They include a program with their code called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MinOZW</code>.  I didn‚Äôt see documentation for it, but it takes the port to monitor
as it‚Äôs first parameter:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>MinOZW /dev/ttyAMA0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That command gave me a flood of Z-wave data, so I knew it was seeing the
controller properly.</p>

<p>Searching the open Mozilla IOT issues revealed that the request to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-iot/zwave-adapter/issues/8">support the Razberry
board was filed a couple weeks ago</a>.  So, I CC‚Äôd myself to keep an eye on
it, and that‚Äôs as far as I got.  So far:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have really high hopes for the Mozilla IoT Gateway</li>
  <li>A first generation Raspberry Pi might be too slow for these shenanigans üòû</li>

Test Pilot program (<a href="http://micropipes.com/blog/2016/01/27/meet-the-new-test-pilot/">some background on the two programs</a>).  The previous
program was similar in that people could give feedback on experiments, but
different enough that we didn‚Äôt feel comfortable simply moving the users to the
new program without some kind of notification and opting-in.</p>

<p>We decided the best way to do that was simply push out a new version of the
legacy add-on which opened a new tab to the Test Pilot website and then
uninstalled itself.  This lets people interested in testing experiments know
about the new program without being overbearing.  Worst case scenario, they
close the tab and have one less add-on loading every time Firefox is started.</p>

<p>In our planning meeting it was suggested that getting three percent of users
from the old program to the new would be a reasonable compromise between
realistic and optimistic.  I guffawed, suggested that the audience had <em>already
opted-in once</em>, and put 6% in as our goal and figured it would be way higher.
Spoiler alert: I was wrong.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll spare you the pain of writing the add-on (most of the trouble was that the
legacy add-on was so old you had to restart Firefox to uninstall it which really
broke up the flow).  On August 24th, we <a href="http://micropipes.com/blog/2016/08/24/time-to-upgrade-from-test-pilot-to-test-pilot/">pushed the update to the old program</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2016-testpilot-adu.png" title="Graph of daily usage" /></p>

<p>In the daily usage graph, you can see we successfully uninstalled ourselves from
several hundred thousand profiles, but we still have a long tail that doesn‚Äôt
seem to be uninstalling.  Fortunately, AMO has really great statistics
dashboards (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/test-pilot/statistics/">these stats are public, by the way</a>) and we can dig a little
deeper.  So, as of today there are around 150k profiles with the old add-on
still installed.  About half of those are reporting running the latest version
(the one that uninstalls itself) and about half are disabled by the user.  I
suspect those halves overlap and account for 75k of the installed profiles.</p>

<p>The second 75k profiles are on older add-on versions and are not upgrading to a
new version.  There could be many reasons when we‚Äôre dealing with profiles this
old: they could be broken, they might not have write permissions to their
profile, their network traffic could be being blocked, an internet security
suite could be misbehaving, etc.  I don‚Äôt think there is much more we can do
for these folks right now, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs talk about the overall goal though - how many people joined the new
program as a result of the new tab?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2016-testpilot-conversions.png" title="Graph of conversions" /></p>

<p>As of the end of Q3, we had just over 26k conversions making for a <em>3.6%
conversion rate</em>.  Quite close to what was suggested in the original meeting by
the people who do this stuff for a living, and quite short of my brash guess.</p>

<p>Overall we got a 0.6 score on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Test_Pilot/2016Q3">quarterly OKR</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Since I‚Äôm writing this post a few weeks after the end of Q3, I can see that
we‚Äôre continuing to get about 80 new users per day from the add-on prompt.
Overall that makes for about 28.5k total conversions as of Oct 27th.</p>]]></content><author><name>Wil Clouser</name></author><category term="Mozilla" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my Q3 goals was to migrate the Legacy Test Pilot users into our new Test Pilot program (some background on the two programs).

localization last quarter and over-rotated on publishing experiments by
launching four when we were only aiming for one.  This quarter we‚Äôll turn that
knob back down (we‚Äôre aiming for two new experiments) and get localization done.</p>

<p>We also failed to graduate any experiments last quarter ‚Äì arguably the most
important part of our entire process since it includes drawing conclusions and
publishing our results.  This quarter we‚Äôll graduate three experiments from Test
Pilot, publish our findings so we can improve Firefox, and clear out space in
Test Pilot for the next big ideas.</p>]]></content><author><name>Wil Clouser</name></author><category term="Mozilla" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Test Pilot 2016 Q4 OKRs are published.

our product requirements as well as keep us flexible enough to evolve quickly
since we were a brand new site.</p>

<p>As the site has grown, we‚Äôve dropped a few requirements, and realized that we
were using <a href="http://basket.readthedocs.io/">APIs from our engagement team</a> to collect newsletter sign ups,
<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Telemetry">APIs from our measurement team</a> for our metrics, and everything else on the
site was essentially HTML and JS.  We used the Django scaffolding for updating
the experiments, but there was no reason we needed to.</p>

<p><em>I‚Äôm happy to highlight that as of today <a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com">testpilot.firefox.com</a> is served
100% statically.</em>  Moving to flat files means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Easier to deploy.  All we do is copy files to an S3 bucket.  No more SQL
migrations or strange half-pushed states.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More secure.  With just flat files we have way less surface area to attack.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Easier to participate in.  You‚Äôll no longer need to set up Docker or a
database.  Just check out the files, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm install</code> and you‚Äôre done.
(disclaimer: we just pushed this today, so we actually still need to update
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/README.md">the documentation</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Excellent change control.  Instead of using an admin panel on the site, we now
use GitHub to manage our <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/tree/master/content-src/experiments">static content</a>.  This means all changes are
tracked for free, we already have a process in place for reviewing pull
requests, and it‚Äôs easy to roll back or manipulate the data because it‚Äôs all
in the repository already.</p>

</ul>

our goal setting.</p>

<p>We all sat down in London and hashed out what direction we wanted to move in for
Q3, what we thought we could do in that timeframe, prioritized the results
and then I <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Test_Pilot/2016Q3">published the results on the wiki</a>.  If you‚Äôre interested in what
Test Pilot did in Q3 you should read that link because it has a bunch of
comments in it.</p>

<p>I knew we deprioritized some of our goals mid-quarter, but I was surprised to
see us come up with a pretty modest <em>.61</em>.  My takeaways from my first time
using the OKR method is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Wording is really important.  Even if you all agree on some words while
sitting around a table, look them over again the next day because they might
not make as much sense as you think.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Getting the goals for your quarter planned before the quarter starts is tops.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having a public list of goals you can point people to is great for your team,
other teams you work with, and anyone in the community interested in your
project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Estimates for how long things will take you is still a Really Hard Problem.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The feedback I‚Äôve received about the OKR process we followed has been
really positive and I expect to continue it in the future.</p>]]></content><author><name>Wil Clouser</name></author><category term="Mozilla" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the third quarter of 2016 the Test Pilot team decided to try using the OKR method (an OKR overview) for our goal setting.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Test Pilot is launching three new experiments for Firefox</title><link href="http://192.168.10.201:4000/2016/09/28/test-pilot-is-launching-three-new-experiments-for-firefox/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Test Pilot is launching three new experiments for Firefox" /><published>2016-09-28T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-09-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://192.168.10.201:4000/2016/09/28/test-pilot-is-launching-three-new-experiments-for-firefox</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://192.168.10.201:4000/2016/09/28/test-pilot-is-launching-three-new-experiments-for-firefox/"><![CDATA[<p>The Test Pilot team has been heads-down for months working on three new
experiments for Firefox and you can get them all today!</p>

<h2 id="min-vid">Min Vid</h2>
<p><a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/min-vid">Min Vid</a> is an add-on that allows you to shrink a video into a small
always-on-top frame in the corner of your browser.  This lets you watch and
interact with a video while browsing the web in other tabs.  Opera and Safari
are implementing similar features so this one might have some sticking power.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/meandave2020">Dave</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jen_kajan">Jen</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/6a68">Jared</a> for taking this from some prototype code to in
front of Firefox users in six months.</p>

<h2 id="tracking-protection">Tracking Protection</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/groovecoder">Luke</a> has been working hard on <a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/tracking-protection">Tracking Protection</a> - an experiment
focused on collecting feedback from users about which sites break when Firefox
blocks the trackers from loading.  As we collect data from everyday users we can
make decisions about how best to block what people don‚Äôt want and still show
them what they do.  Eventually this could lead to us protecting all Firefox
users with Tracking Protection by default.</p>

<h2 id="page-shot">Page Shot</h2>
<p><a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/page-shot">Page Shot</a> is a snappy experiment that enables users to quickly take
screenshots in their browser and share them on the internet.  There are a few
companies in this space already, but their products always felt too heavy to me,
or they ignored privacy, or some simply didn‚Äôt even work (this was on Linux).
Page Shot is light and quick and works great everywhere.</p>

<p>As a bonus, a feature I haven‚Äôt seen anywhere else, Page Shot also offers
searching the text within the images themselves.  So if you take a screenshot of
a pizza recipe and later search for ‚Äúmozzarella‚Äù it will find the recipe.</p>

<p>I was late to the Page Shot party and my involvement is just standing on the
shoulders of giants at this point: by the time I was involved the final touches
were already being put on.  A big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ianbicking">Ian</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/donovanpreston">Donovan</a> for bringing
this project to life.</p>

<p>I called out the engineers who have been working to bring their creations to
life, but of course there are so many teams who were critical to today‚Äôs
launches.  A big thank you to the people who have been working tirelessly and
congratulations on launching your products! :)</p>]]></content><author><name>Wil Clouser</name></author><category term="Mozilla" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Test Pilot team has been heads-down for months working on three new experiments for Firefox and you can get them all today!]]></summary></entry></feed>

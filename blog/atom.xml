password hashes which will improve security and increase flexibility around
changing emails.  The changes are entirely transparent to end-users and are
applied automatically when someone logs in.</p>

<h2 id="randomizing-salts">Randomizing Salts</h2>

<p>If a system is going to store passwords, best practice is to hash the password
with a unique salt per row.  When accounts was first built we used an account’s
email address as the unique salt for password hashing.  This saved a column in
the database and some bandwidth but overall I think was a poor idea.  It meant
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/issues/14178">people couldn’t re-use their email
addresses</a> and it leaves <abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr> sitting around
unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Instead, a better idea is just to generate a random salt.  We’ve now
transitioned Mozilla Accounts to random salts.</p>

<h2 id="increasing-key-stretching-iterations">Increasing Key Stretching Iterations</h2>

<p>Eight years ago <a href="https://www.rfk.id.au/">Ryan Kelly</a> filed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1320222">bug
1320222</a> to review
Mozilla Accounts’ client-side key stretching capabilities and sparked a
spirited conversation about iterations and the priority of the bug.  Overall,
this is routine maintenance - we expect any amount of stretching we do will
have to be revisited periodically due to hardware improving and the value we
choose is a compromise between security and time to login, particularly on
older hardware.</p>

<p>Since we were generating new hashes for the random salts already we took the
opportunity to increase our PBKDF2 iterations from 1000 to 650000 – a number
we’re seeing others in the industry using.  This means logging in with slower
hardware (like older mobile phones) may be noticeably slower.  Below is an
excerpt from the analysis we did showing a Macbook from 2007 will take an
additional ~3 seconds to log in:</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dschom">Dan Schomburg</a> did the heavy lifting to make this a
smooth and successful project.  He built the v2 system alongside v1 so both
hashes are generated simultaneously and if the v2 exists the login system will
use that.  This lets us roll the feature out slowly and gives us control if we
need to disable it or roll back.</p>

<p>We tested the code for several months on our staging server before rolling it
out in production.  When we did enable it in production it was over the course
of several weeks via small percentages while we watched for unintended
side-effects and bug reports.</p>

<p>I’m pleased to say everything appers to be working smoothly.  As always, if you
notice any issues please <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/issues">let us know</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Wil Clouser</name></author><category term="Mozilla" /><category term="software" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve recently finished two significant changes to how Mozilla Accounts handles password hashes which will improve security and increase flexibility around changing emails.

It has some simple
backup options built-in but I didn’t see any encrypted options.  Since I use
<a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">Borg</a> elsewhere I thought this was a good
opportunity to figure out how to put it on TrueNAS. TrueNAS is based on Debian,
but relying on direct package installations isn’t recommended so I needed
another option.</p>

<p>I was going to use <a href="https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/borg-server/">TrueCharts’ borg chart</a> but TrueNAS SCALE is
<a href="https://forums.truenas.com/t/the-future-of-electric-eel-and-apps/5409/7">phasing out support for charts completely</a>
so I opted to install a binary manually and see if a standard approach appears
later.  It turned out to be pretty straight forward, steps below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download a <a href="https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/releases">borg binary</a>.
You’ll want to use a version of the unfortunately-named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">borg-linuxnewer64</code>
builds which are built for Debian 12.  I used the latest stable version,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.2.8</code>.</li>
  <li>Copy the binary somewhere.  I put it in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/mnt/bin/</code>.</li>
  <li>Try to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/mnt/bin/borg -V</code>.  If you get an error saying
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/mnt/bin/borg: error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1: failed to
map segment from shared object</code> you need to add a temp directory it can
write to.  I made <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/mnt/tmp</code> and then ran <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">export TMPDIR="/mnt/tmp"</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/mnt/bin/borg -V</code> should work and you can add it to whatever scripts you
use to backup your system.  Don’t forget to set the TMPDIR in your scripts too.</p>]]></content><author><name>Wil Clouser</name></author><category term="software" /><category term="walkthrough" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I installed TrueNAS a couple months ago to try out ZFS.

Accounts is turning off SyncStorage BrowserID support and it probably doesn’t
affect you at all.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2>

<p>In 2011, when Mozilla Accounts (called “Firefox Accounts” back then) was first
built it used BrowserID identity certificates in its authentication model.  The
BrowserID protocol never took off and Mozilla’s work on it ended in 2016.
However, the sync service in Firefox continued to use BrowserID even as OAuth
support was added to Mozilla Accounts as an alternative for all other relying
parties.</p>

<p>Over time, we recognized BrowserID was becoming a maintenance liability.  As a
non-standard protocol it created significant complexity in our codebase.
Therefore, we decided to migrate the Firefox clients off of it in favor of
OAuth.</p>

<p>This was an enormous effort, and while much more could be written about this
transition, the main takeaway is that Firefox Sync’s BrowserID support ended
with Firefox 78, which shipped in June 2020 and reached its end of life in
November 2021.</p>

<h2 id="present-day">Present day</h2>

<p>We’ve been waiting a long time for the usage of Firefox 78 to drop.</p>

<p>Aside from being an <abbr title="Extended Support Release">ESR</abbr> version
there are a couple of other reasons for its extra longevity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was the last version of the browser to support Flash</li>
  <li>It was the last version of the browser to support OS X versions &lt; 10.12</li>
</ul>

<p>With Flash now largely obsolete on the web and traffic from older operating
systems becoming rarer, we’ve decided that now is the appropriate time to turn
off support for this legacy protocol.</p>

<p>To avoid surprises and not leave anyone behind, we attempted to email anyone
still using that endpoint earlier this year. We didn’t receive any feedback and
we continued with the plan.</p>

<h2 id="our-method">Our method</h2>

<p>Our plan is simple:  BrowserID requests are the only traffic hitting our
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/v1/certificate/sign</code> endpoint.  We’ll begin returning <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTTP 404</code> replies to a
small percentage of traffic from that endpoint and monitor for any issues.
Our testing showed no concerns but it’s challenging to be comprehensive with so
many combinations of browser versions and operating systems.  Over the next few
weeks we’ll continue to ramp up the percentage of 404s until we can remove the
endpoint completely and let the traffic bounce off the front-end like any other
404.</p>

<h2 id="current-status">Current status</h2>

<p>Surprise!  I’m a few weeks late with this post.  We started returning 404s on
May 1 and are currently up to ~66% of traffic on that endpoint.  So far there
haven’t been any unexpected complications.  We’ll continue to increase over the
next few weeks and aim to have all the code removed this summer.</p>]]></content><author><name>Wil Clouser</name></author><category term="Mozilla" /><category term="software" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The tl;dr here is that Mozilla Accounts is turning off SyncStorage BrowserID support and it probably doesn’t affect you at all.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">OBEY PROPAGANDA ENGINEERING</title><link href="https://micropipes.com/2024/05/10/obey-propaganda-engineering/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="OBEY PROPAGANDA ENGINEERING" /><published>2024-05-10T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-05-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://micropipes.com/2024/05/10/obey-propaganda-engineering</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://micropipes.com/2024/05/10/obey-propaganda-engineering/"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/img/2024-art-obey-propaganda-1.jpg" alt="Sign hanging on the wall" /></p>

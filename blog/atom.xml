Accounts is turning off SyncStorage BrowserID support and it probably doesn’t
affect you at all.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2>

<p>In 2011, when Mozilla Accounts (called “Firefox Accounts” back then) was first
built it used BrowserID identity certificates in its authentication model.  The
BrowserID protocol never took off and Mozilla’s work on it ended in 2016.
However, the sync service in Firefox continued to use BrowserID even as OAuth
support was added to Mozilla Accounts as an alternative for all other relying
parties.</p>

<p>Over time, we recognized BrowserID was becoming a maintenance liability.  As a
non-standard protocol it created significant complexity in our codebase.
Therefore, we decided to migrate the Firefox clients off of it in favor of
OAuth.</p>

<p>This was an enormous effort, and while much more could be written about this
transition, the main takeaway is that Firefox Sync’s BrowserID support ended
with Firefox 78, which shipped in June 2020 and reached its end of life in
November 2021.</p>

<h2 id="present-day">Present day</h2>

<p>We’ve been waiting a long time for the usage of Firefox 78 to drop.</p>

<p>Aside from being an <abbr title="Extended Support Release">ESR</abbr> version
there are a couple of other reasons for its extra longevity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was the last version of the browser to support Flash</li>
  <li>It was the last version of the browser to support OS X versions &lt; 10.12</li>
</ul>

<p>With Flash now largely obsolete on the web and traffic from older operating
systems becoming rarer, we’ve decided that now is the appropriate time to turn
off support for this legacy protocol.</p>

<p>To avoid surprises and not leave anyone behind, we attempted to email anyone
still using that endpoint earlier this year. We didn’t receive any feedback and
we continued with the plan.</p>

<h2 id="our-method">Our method</h2>

<p>Our plan is simple:  BrowserID requests are the only traffic hitting our
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/v1/certificate/sign</code> endpoint.  We’ll begin returning <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTTP 404</code> replies to a
small percentage of traffic from that endpoint and monitor for any issues.
Our testing showed no concerns but it’s challenging to be comprehensive with so
many combinations of browser versions and operating systems.  Over the next few
weeks we’ll continue to ramp up the percentage of 404s until we can remove the
endpoint completely and let the traffic bounce off the front-end like any other
404.</p>

<h2 id="current-status">Current status</h2>

<p>Surprise!  I’m a few weeks late with this post.  We started returning 404s on
May 1 and are currently up to ~66% of traffic on that endpoint.  So far there
haven’t been any unexpected complications.  We’ll continue to increase over the
next few weeks and aim to have all the code removed this summer.</p>]]></content><author><name>Wil Clouser</name></author><category term="Mozilla" /><category term="software" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The tl;dr here is that Mozilla Accounts is turning off SyncStorage BrowserID support and it probably doesn’t affect you at all.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">OBEY PROPAGANDA ENGINEERING</title><link href="http://192.168.10.201:4000/2024/05/10/obey-propaganda-engineering/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="OBEY PROPAGANDA ENGINEERING" /><published>2024-05-10T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-05-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://192.168.10.201:4000/2024/05/10/obey-propaganda-engineering</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://192.168.10.201:4000/2024/05/10/obey-propaganda-engineering/"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/img/2024-art-obey-propaganda-1.jpg" alt="Sign hanging on the wall" /></p>

decode Silke Communication’s <a href="https://www.silkecom.com/fleetnet">FleetNet Network</a>
radio traffic around me.  After some configuration effort it’s working well,
but I realized one of the things I’ve really appreciated about the past decade
is the slow migration to asynchronous communications (email, messages, etc.)
instead of voice calls or in-person meetings that interrupt whatever I’m doing.
I don’t want to actually listen to the radio traffic, rather, I’d like to skim
it, preferably visually, after-the-fact to see if anything interesting
happened.</p>

<p>Maybe we can automatically transcribe it?</p>

<p>Historically, automatic transcription hasn’t been great, even in ideal
environments, let alone something as sketchy as a radio where calls can fade
and a good percentage of the words are jargon.  But this is 2024 and AI rules
the day, right?  Maybe things are better.</p>

<p>DSD FME can be configured to dump every call to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.wav</code> file in a directory
which takes care of the source audio.</p>

<p>I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/clouserw/dsd-fme-transcribe">short python script</a>
which watches a directory for file handles closing (meaning, the call is over)
and sends the files through <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">OpenAI’s Whisper</a> library to convert it to text.
Running it while audio files are coming in provides a roughly real-time
transcription.  Example output from this evening while the local school buses
were dropping off students:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TG Bus Dispatch RID 8703: 237 to central.</p>

  <p>TG Bus Dispatch RID 8761: 2-3-7 standby just a moment. 2-3-2 go ahead.</p>

  <p>TG Bus Dispatch RID 8784: I just wanted to update you that I’m route complete. Thank you.</p>

  <p>TG Bus Dispatch RID 8761: Okay, 10-4. Thank you. Go ahead. Two, three, seven.</p>

  <p>TG Bus Dispatch RID 8761: 274 standby just a moment. I got one more route calling in here. 237, I’m ready for you. Go ahead 237.</p>

  <p>TG Bus Dispatch RID 8703: So it is closed and I have three stops down there. What do I do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The system works!  Is it accurate?</p>

<p>Ehh.  I’d say it’s about 75% accurate after watching it for a bit.  It gets
most of the messages but does trip up occasionally.  I’m using the <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper?tab=readme-ov-file#available-models-and-languages">base model</a>
because my computer isn’t very fast but using a larger model may improve the
accuracy.  Even better would be to train a model on radio communications. One
similar example where they did tune their model is <a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:8aa780bf-47b6-4f81-b112-29e23bc06a7d?collection=education">this thesis applying the technique</a>
to air traffic control radio.  They achieved a ~13% error rate with a pretty
challenging data set.</p>

<p>Is this revolutionary?</p>

<p>Not really.  There are <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/categories/show-and-tell">many examples</a>
of using Whisper to decode audio like this, even in real time.  I wrote this
because all the examples seem too complicated for someone just looking at the
library for the first time and it’s fun to start and finish a project in a
couple of hours!</p>]]></content><author><name>Wil Clouser</name></author><category term="software" /><category term="radio" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve recently been using DSD FME to decode Silke Communication’s FleetNet Network radio traffic around me.

So, here we are.  I’m using the USB interface.</p>

<p>Unfortunately you’ll need to install the <a href="https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads">CP210x USB to UART Bridge Virtual COM Port driver</a> manually.</p>

<p>With the radio plugged in, <em>turned on</em>, and the drivers installed try listing your USB devices:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  ~% ioreg -p IOUSB

  [...]

  | +-o IOUSBHostDevice@02100000  &lt;class IOUSBHostDevice, id 0x1000abb83, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (5243 ms), retain 30&gt;
  |   +-o CP2105 Dual USB to UART Bridge Controller@02110000  &lt;class IOUSBHostDevice, id 0x1000abb90, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (5218 ms), retain 28&gt;
  |   +-o USB Audio CODEC @02120000  &lt;class IOUSBHostDevice, id 0x1000abb9d, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (58 ms), retain 33&gt;

  [...]

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The ones to look for here are the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CP2105 Dual USB to UART Bridge Controller</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USB
Audio CODEC</code>.  If they are listed your computer can see the radio.  If not, try
pressing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">menu</code> on the radio and confirm that option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">037 CAT SELECT</code> is set to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USB</code>.</p>

<p>Most of the radio’s default options are fine, but there are a few to adjust:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">038 CAT RATE</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">38400</code> (default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4800</code>).</li>
  <li>Set option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">075 DATA IN SELECT</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USB</code> (default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DATA</code>)</li>
  <li>Set option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">077 DATA OUT LEVEL</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> (default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">50</code>)</li>
  <li>Set option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">103 SSB MIC SEL</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USB</code> (default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FRONT</code>).  Tip: Program your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C.S</code> key for this option so it’s easy to switch back to the front microphone.</li>
</ul>

<p>When using the radio for FT8 I also set these options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IPO</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IPO</code></li>
  <li>Set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ATT</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OFF</code></li>
  <li>Set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PROC</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OFF</code> (this option is behind the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCOPE</code> button)</li>
  <li>Set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MIC EQ</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OFF</code> (also behind the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCOPE</code> button)</li>
</ul>

<p>On OS X you’ll need to install <a href="https://wsjt.sourceforge.io/wsjtx.html">WSJT-X</a>.  WSJT-X can control the radio directly so no need for any other software radios.  These are my settings:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2023-wsjt-x-settings.png" alt="A screenshot of the radio tab of the WSJT-X settings window." /></p>

<p>I have two serial ports provided by the radio, one regular and one “enhanced” -
only the enhanced one works.</p>]]></content><author><name>Wil Clouser</name></author><category term="radio" /><category term="walkthrough" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are plenty of walkthroughs online about setting up FT8 on the DX-3000 with Windows but I didn’t find any for OS X.

<h3 id="set-up-the-containers">Set up the containers</h3>

<p>Lately I’ve been trying to compartmentalize things, so I want to run Grafana and
InfluxDB in Docker.  There are <a href="https://github.com/philhawthorne/docker-influxdb-grafana">options</a> that run them all in the same container,
but I liked <a href="https://github.com/nicolargo/docker-influxdb-grafana">nicolargo/docker-influxdb-grafana</a> which is essentially just a
simple docker-compose file that uses base (read: maintained) images.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>git checkout https://github.com/nicolargo/docker-influxdb-grafana.git

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker-compose.yml</code> there are two <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">volumes</code> keys that link out to the
disk.  I modified those paths, but otherwise didn’t make any changes.  By
setting up the volumes here, I’ll have persistent storage beyond restarts.</p>

<p>When I first tried to run the containers, the Grafana container failed with
permission problems.  Grafana <a href="http://docs.grafana.org/installation/docker/#migration-from-a-previous-version-of-the-docker-container-to-5-1-or-later">mentions some permissions changes in a different context</a>,
but following these steps fixed my issues also:</p>

<span class="c"># then within the container, run:</span>

<p>After that the containers fired right up:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>docker-compose up <span class="nt">-d</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="set-up-influxdb">Set up InfluxDB</h3>

<p>InfluxDB is running now, but I need to add the new user and database.  First I
opened a shell with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker exec -it influxdb influx</code> and then made the
changes:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; create database openhab
&gt; create user openhab with password "openhab"
&gt; grant all on openhab to openhab
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="getting-data-into-influxdb">Getting data into InfluxDB</h3>

<p>As with the rest of this walkthrough, someone already did the hard parts, so I
really just need to install a plugin for openHAB.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Load the PaperUI in openHAB</li>
  <li>Click Add-ons in the left menu</li>
  <li>Click Persistence in the top menu</li>
  <li>Click Install next to InfluxDB Persistence</li>
</ol>

<p>Next I’ll SSH into the openHAB box and edit or create two configuration files.
Copies of mine are below.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># /etc/openhab2/services/influxdb.cfg

# This is the URL for influxdb.  Don't forget the port.
url=http://192.168.1.2:8086
user=openhab
password=openhab
db=openhab
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># /etc/openhab2/persistence/influxdb.persist

Strategies {
    everyMinute : "0 * * * * ?"
    everyHour   : "0 0 * * * ?"
    everyDay    : "0 0 0 * * ?"

    default = everyChange
}

Items {
    *   : strategy = everyChange, everyHour
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I have an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> in my Items declaration because I want to send everything to
InfluxDB.  That can be changed to specific Items or Groups to narrow down what
is sent if desired.</p>

<p>With those files in place, openHAB will send data to InfluxDB every time
something changes and every hour.  I had to restart openHAB for the changes to
take effect:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>systemctl restart openhab2
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="make-sure-data-is-flowing">Make sure data is flowing</h3>

<p>Look at the logs for InfluxDB by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker-compose logs influxdb</code>.
openHAB should have sent a hello:</p>

<blockquote>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>influxdb</td>
        <td>[httpd] 192.168.1.1 - - [02/Dec/2018:02:21:49 +0000] “GET /ping HTTP/1.1” 204 0 “-“ “okhttp/2.4.0”</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</blockquote>

<p>Depending on how much activity there is in openHAB there may be other entries in
the logs also.  To double check inside InfluxDB itself try this:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>docker <span class="nb">exec</span> <span class="nt">-it</span> influxdb influx

<span class="c"># And then inside the influxdb client</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> use openhab
<span class="o">&gt;</span> show measurements
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A list of all the measurements sent so far will display.  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">select * from
somekey</code> will dig into the data itself.</p>

<h3 id="set-up-grafana">Set up Grafana</h3>

<p>The Grafana interface is on port 3000 by default and the credentials are
admin/admin.  On first login Grafana shows a wizard interface, so this moves
along pretty quickly.  The new Data Source is the InfluxDB type, probably with
a URL of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://influxdb:8086</code>.  Docker-compose does the DNS for free here.</p>

<p>I’ll put a Graph panel on a new dashboard and click the title of it to edit.
The metrics tab has the queries and since the data is already flowing in, the
correctly named Keys appear in a dropdown when I’m editing them.  The query can
stay mostly as defaults, here is what mine looks like:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2018-dashboard-two.png" alt="Grafana congfiguration" /></p>

<p>My Key names (eg. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HVAC_Temperature</code>) come from how I set the device up in openHAB.</p>

<p>The only other thing to change here is in the Display tab: I set the Null Value
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connected</code> so I’ll have a nicely drawn line chart even though the
Temperature only changes periodically.</p>

<h3 id="one-more-bit-of-fanciness">One more bit of fanciness</h3>

<p>I have a wood stove that I use in winter, but if it gets below a certain
temperature (depending on the time of day) I have my furnace kick on.  I wanted
to be able to see when my furnace was coming on, so I decided to make use of
Grafana’s Annotations capability (the red vertical lines in the top image).</p>

<p>From within the dashboard I clicked the Settings Gear in the header (not the
one on the left) and chose Annotations.  From there I made a new Annotation
with a custom query:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">HVAC_Operating_State</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="err">$</span><span class="n">timeFilter</span> <span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="nb">time</span> <span class="k">ASC</span> <span class="k">LIMIT</span> <span class="mi">10</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AND $timeFilter</code> is important.  As before, mine is named
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HVAC_Operating_State</code> because that’s what I named the Item in openHAB when I
set it up.</p>

<p>And that’s it.  Returning to the dashboard after 24 hours should show something
like the graph at the top of this post.</p>]]></content><author><name>Wil Clouser</name></author><category term="automation" /><category term="walkthrough" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post I’ll set up the software needed to store data from openHAB and display it on a dashboard.

I’m posting anyway because it’s ok to fail. :)</em></p>

<p>Last weekend I was inspired by <a href="http://www.twobraids.com/2018/02/lars-and-real-internet-of-things-part-1.html">Lars’s posts on IoT</a> to try <a href="https://iot.mozilla.org/gateway/">Mozilla’s Things
Gateway</a>.</p>

<p>I have an old Raspberry Pi 1 Model B with a <a href="https://razberry.z-wave.me/">RaZberry Z-Wave Daughterboard</a>
which I had soldered a larger external antenna on to last year.  I used to run
OpenHAB on it to control some z-wave devices before I moved last year and since
then it’s just been in a box.  Let’s fire it up!</p>

<p>This original Raspberry Pi is a single core 700mhz CPU, so I’m planning on
running it headless and doing everything remotely over SSH to save on GUI
resources.</p>

<p><img style="border:1px solid #aaa;" src="/assets/img/2018.raspberry.pi.1.jpg" /></p>

<p>Firstly, since I hadn’t plugged this in forever, I booted it up, uninstalled
OpenHAB and the RaZberry software and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspbian-stretch/">upgraded Raspbian to the latest
version</a>.  It’s still as
easy as it should be, just edit the sources.list and:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># apt-get update</span>
<span class="c"># apt-get dist-upgrade</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I left the upgrade running over night because it was taking so long – a
foreshadowing of things to come! 😩</p>

<p>On the suggestion of the page I linked to above, I removed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pulseaudio</code> since I
don’t use it.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># sudo apt-get purge "pulseaudio*"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla-iot/gateway/blob/master/README.md">The instructions for installing the Gateway</a> are great and easy to follow.</p>

<p>I installed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvm</code> as recommended, although so far I’m regretting it.  It takes
12 seconds to start a new login shell now while nvm executes the stuff it put
in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code>.  If I end up logging in very often I’ll get rid of it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Node world does do permissions well.  Most tools can
install in a users home directory without any root permissions, which I was
happy to do:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>curl <span class="nt">-o-</span> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash
<span class="nv">$ </span>nvm <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">--lts</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>nvm use <span class="nt">--lts</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>npm <span class="nt">--version</span>
5.6.0
<span class="nv">$ </span>node <span class="nt">--version</span>
v8.9.4
<span class="nv">$ </span>npm <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">--global</span> yarn
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next up was OpenZWave.  Their documentation mentions supporting the Razberry
card, so I felt good about things working.  When you get to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make</code> command,
go grab some lunch – this also took plenty of time.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave.git
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>open-zwave
<span class="nv">$ </span>make <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">sudo </span>make <span class="nb">install</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>ldconfig
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, I’m ready to install the Things Gateway.  For a project that is still
new and moving quickly I like to install directly out of Git which makes
testing patches and upgrading to new versions easy (I hope!).</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/mozilla-iot/gateway.git
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>gateway
<span class="nv">$ </span>yarn  <span class="c"># Yarn actually prints how long it takes to execute.  This took 6070.32 seconds! 💤</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I don’t want to use Mozilla’s tunneling service, so I faked some SSL:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> ssl
<span class="nv">$ </span>openssl genrsa <span class="nt">-out</span> ssl/privatekey.pem 2048
<span class="nv">$ </span>openssl req <span class="nt">-new</span> <span class="nt">-sha256</span> <span class="nt">-key</span> ssl/privatekey.pem <span class="nt">-out</span> ssl/csr.pem
<span class="nv">$ </span>openssl x509 <span class="nt">-req</span> <span class="nt">-in</span> ssl/csr.pem <span class="nt">-signkey</span> ssl/privatekey.pem <span class="nt">-out</span> ssl/certificate.pem
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then start the web server.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>npm start  <span class="c"># This takes around 4 minutes to finish starting :(</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Loading the site in my browser works!   I click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">settings</code> -&gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add-ons</code> and
install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z-wave device support</code>.  However, watching the console I can see it
fail to find the z-wave interface.</p>

<p>I dug around in the code and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-iot/zwave-adapter/blob/master/zwave-adapter.js#L368">found the findZWavePort() code</a> that does the
detection, and confrimed that it’s looking at USB ports which won’t work for
the Razberry which comes in on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/ttyAMA0</code>.</p>

<div class="aside">
<p>I'm just going to stick in a little aside here...</p>

<p>I modified the <code>zwave-adapter.js</code> file to add some logging and
make sure that was as far as it was getting and restarted the server (which,
took 4 minutes...) and then saw the module failed to load because the checksum
didn't match.  I deleted the checksum file (4 minutes...), and it failed again,
so I finally just removed the one line from the checksum file.</p>

<p>The checksum is a great idea and I assume there is some kind of flag I can pass
to the server to ignore it, but I haven't found it yet.</p>
</div>

<p>One last thing I wanted to verify before I dug too far into the Gateway was to
make sure OpenZWave was working.  They include a program with their code called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MinOZW</code>.  I didn’t see documentation for it, but it takes the port to monitor
as it’s first parameter:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>MinOZW /dev/ttyAMA0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That command gave me a flood of Z-wave data, so I knew it was seeing the
controller properly.</p>

<p>Searching the open Mozilla IOT issues revealed that the request to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-iot/zwave-adapter/issues/8">support the Razberry
board was filed a couple weeks ago</a>.  So, I CC’d myself to keep an eye on
it, and that’s as far as I got.  So far:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have really high hopes for the Mozilla IoT Gateway</li>
  <li>A first generation Raspberry Pi might be too slow for these shenanigans 😞</li>

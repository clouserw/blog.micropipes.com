> I'm pleased to present a couple of dashboards I made over the break for the
> Marketplace.  Behold:
> 
> 1) How many bugs were closed this week?
>   <a href="https://metaplace.paas.allizom.org/bugskiosk/">https://metaplace.paas.allizom.org/bugskiosk/</a>
> 
>   I actually had the code for that one already laying around, so that was
>   just to see if Andy was taking pull requests on metaplace. :)
>
>2) What waffles are what?
>    <a href="https://metaplace.paas.allizom.org/waffles/">https://metaplace.paas.allizom.org/waffles/</a>
>
>    A long standing complaint is that it's hard to tell what waffles we have
>    on which site.  Not anymore - now you can instantly get two scoops of
>    knowledge as a healthy part of this complete dashboard. (prod's API isn't
>    live so nothing in that column yet)
>
> 3) That API seems slow, but maybe it's just me...  <a
> href="https://metaplace.paas.allizom.org/apikiosk/">https://metaplace.paas.allizom.org/apikiosk/</a>
> 
>    A close runner up in concerns, some of our API speeds have been
>    questionable but it's hard to point to a problem when we're trying to find
>    a graphite graph (behind auth) or it's only happening to you and you can
>    screenshot it but it may just be slow that day or something.  Now we have
>    our own personal arewefastyet.com so we can point to real(-time) data on
>    our API speeds (measured from around the world via pingdom).  See the
>    other thread on this list ("[RFC] API performance standards") for more
>    thoughts on this
>
> Happy 2014!

title: Differentiate Bugzilla emails?
tags:
- Mozilla
---
<p><a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla is an awesome bug tracker</a> that is used by <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/installation-list/">hundreds of companies</a>.  I've got accounts on several projects' trackers and I'm sure many others do also.</p>
<p>When I get mail from Bugzilla it's not obvious which project it's from.  My email client (GMail) only shows the "from name" so all I see for these projects is:</p>
<p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>: bugzilla-daemon<br />
<a href="http://bugs.locamotion.org/">Pootle</a>: bugzilla-daemon<br />
<a href="http://bugzilla.pculture.org/">Miro</a>: bugzilla<br />
<a href="http://bugzilla.kernel.org/">kernel.org</a>: bugme-daemon<br />
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/">Apache</a>: bugzilla</p>
<p>Wouldn't it make sense to differentiate each projects' emails in the from name?  Maybe even by default (something like "%SITE_NAME% Bugzilla")?</p>
<p>Reed says it's a personal problem because his mail client shows the full address.  Am I the only one? :(</p>

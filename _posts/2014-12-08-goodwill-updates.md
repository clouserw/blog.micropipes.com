title: Goodwill Updates: A Firefox OS Feature Idea

A common aspect amongst the regions Firefox OS targets is a lack of dependable
bandwidth. Mobile data (if available) can be slow and expensive, wi-fi 
connections are rare, and in-home internet completely absent. With the lack of
regular or affordable connectivity, itâ€™s easy for people to ignore device and
app updates and instead opt to focus on downloading their content.

Currently, Firefox OS pings for system and app updates every day and downloads
them when available.  Once it has downloaded the update it is discarded.

What if there was an option in Firefox OS to enable goodwill update caching and
distribution?  Instead of discarding the updates, they are stored on the phone
and the next time they are near another Firefox OS phone which doesn't have the
updates they are copied over and the phone is updated to the latest versions -
getting new features and important security updates.

This could be mostly in the background (assuming disk space and battery life, it
just works) or more in the foreground where people could get a notification
about a nearby phone and the host phone could see in real time how much
bandwidth and money has been saved.

Would this help relieve pressure on users in emerging markets?

PS. Hat tip to Katie and [Tiffanie][2] for the image and idea help.

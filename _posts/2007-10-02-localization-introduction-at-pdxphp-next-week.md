<p>I'm going to be in Portland next week giving a casual introduction to
localization at <a href="http://pdxphp.org/meetings/2007/october">PDXPHP's
October meeting</a>.  It's scheduled for 6:30pm on October 9th, so stop by if
you're in the neighborhood, and feel free to bring questions.</p>

<p>Oh, and going to the <a
href="http://slashdot.org/anniversary.pl?view_id=15">Slashdot 10-year
anniversary party</a> isn't an excuse to miss this. :) You can come to PDXPHP,
talk about <abbr title="Localization">L10n</abbr>, fill up on pizza, and still
show up fashionably late to the Slashdot party.</p>

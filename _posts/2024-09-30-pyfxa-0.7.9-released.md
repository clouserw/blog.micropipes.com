We released [PyFxA 0.7.9](https://github.com/mozilla/PyFxA/releases/tag/0.7.9) last week ([pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pyfxa/)).  This added:

- Support for key stretching v2.  See the end of [bug
  1320222](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1320222) for some
  details.  V1 will continue to work, but we'll remove support for it at some
  point in the future.
- Upgraded to support (and test!) Python 3

Special thanks to [Rob Hudson](https://rob.cogit8.org/) and [Dan Schomburg](https://github.com/dschom) for thier efforts.

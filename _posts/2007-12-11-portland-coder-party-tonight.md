<p>Sorry for the short notice but there is a <a href="http://pdxphp.org/meetings/2007/december">December Coders Bash</a> tonight that Mozilla is helping sponsor.  It starts at 7pm at <a href="http://www.cubespacepdx.com/">CubeSpace</a>.  Drop by if you get a chance - it's informal and sounds like a bunch of fun.  Stealing from the linked page:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of the events we are considering (subject to change due to group consensus)...</p>
<ul>
<li>I remember when, the BS game (any story of geekery, starting with "I remember when" or "I was there when" allowed, and then you call BS or not.</li>
<li>Name That Language. Snippets from obscure and entertaining languages posted. Can you recognize an algorithm in whitespace if it's surrounded by poetry?</li>
<li>5 Minute Code Sprints: 5 minutes to solve a problem. Prove your language best, or shortest, or most obscure. Whatever you like.</li>
<li>"I can name that programming language in 3 lines of code": Name that language Duels. Challenge your opponent that you can name a Programing language by seeing less lines of code than them.</li>
<li>Best WTF snippet: Do your worst and be the best</li>
</ul>

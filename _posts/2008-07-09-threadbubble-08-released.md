<p>A new version of ThreadBubble is available.  Changes include:</p>

* <b>Thunderbird 3 Support</b>: Tested on the latest nightly and working fine.  This also means a lot of the code was cleaned up and made simpler.  (Thunderbird 2 still works)
* Fixed a bug when sorted ascending where new messages wouldn't sink to the bottom of the list.

<p>Someone already tested this update and had no problems so I'm putting it
online.  If I don't hear any complaints by next week I'll push it live on <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/">AMO</a> and everyone can get the update
automatically.  Thanks!</p>

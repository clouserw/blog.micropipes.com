title: Why doesn't the Android Market keep us up to date?
---
The Android platform comes with a great market available for browsing and
downloading applications.  Comments are easy to read, the permissions the
application is requesting are clearly explained, and installing is a snap and
happens in the background.  Overall it's a breeze to use.  However, it's got a
large gap in it's model that I haven't seen addressed anywhere - there are no
automatic updates for the applications.

When I install an application I'm stuck with the version I get unless I
happen to check the Android market, go find the application again, and attempt
to reinstall it.  There is no indication that an update is available until after
I've clicked the "Install" button again at which point it explains it will
replace the existing installation.

In this first wave of applications for the G1 a lot of developers either
skipped some features or avoided adding some final polish in their rush to be
first in the store.  Now their application is available to everyone and they
have no (built-in) way of keeping people up to date.

When I see interesting applications with some complaints in the comments I'm
tempted to hold off installing them because there might be updates in a few days
and I'd rather have the new versions (there's no way I'm going to be reviewing
all my apps and checking for new versions).  That's ridiculous!

In an attempt to fix this oversight several applications have added code that
does its own checks for updates.  If this is the route developers are forced to
take we're looking at bigger downloads taking up more space on our devices,
additional bugs since everyone has to write the script themselves, slower
devices with less usable RAM, and additional security bypasses (the applications
with update scripts in them require permission to access the internet and start
when the device starts).

Automatic updates should have launched with the market to save developers'
time and keep people up to date.  As it stands now, I guess I'll add it to my
Christmas list for <del>Santa</del> Google.

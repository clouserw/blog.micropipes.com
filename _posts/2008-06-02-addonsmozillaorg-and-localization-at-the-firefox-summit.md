<p>We're planning several sessions at <a
href="http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2008/05/13/upcoming-firefox-plus-summit/">the
upcoming Firefox summit</a> including one specifically about <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/">AMO</a> and <abbr
title="Localization">L10n</abbr> in which we hope to connect with localizers and
start looking at some of the pain points of localizing AMO.  With that in mind
I've been collecting topic ideas and I'd like to hear any others you have.  On
my list so far:</p>

* <strong>Connecting localizers and add-on authors.</strong>  The only way to
  localize add-ons and metadata right now is if the author knows someone who can
  translate the extension or by using an existing service like <a
  href="http://babelzilla.org/">BabelZilla</a>.  It would be nice to add an easy
  way to connect these two without overwhelming localizers or creating a
  bottleneck.
* <strong>Being notified of AMO string updates.</strong>  Right now we have RSS
  feeds and the mailing list.  It would be nice to have something more concrete
  and consistently up to date.
* <strong>Use normal .po files or make the ones we have easier to use.</strong>
  This <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=412597">came up
  before</a> and was <a
  href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=430491">discussed again
  briefly</a>.  I don't expect to convert to using standard .po files now that
  we can provide English fallback in the application.  However, we can make them
  easier to use particularly with the small (size and number) of updates for
  AMO.

<p>What other ideas and pain points would you like to discuss at the summit?
Leave a comment with ideas.</p>

<p>Also, I expect <a
href="/blog/2008/05/28/making-life-easier-for-localizers-introducing-verbatim/">Verbatim</a>
to come up in our discussions since it's still in planning and now is the time
to add features.  If you have ideas for AMO in a Verbatim context feel free to
add them also.</p>

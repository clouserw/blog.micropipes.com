I looked everywhere for a case for [W8BH's Morse Tutor project](http://w8bh.net)[1].
The only one I found was a [3d printed one for the previous revision](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4190589) with the smaller screen.

I have the ESP32 version with the 3.2" screen and to protect it and make it
easier to hold I made a crude case for it on a laser cutter.  If you'd like to
make one you're welcome to [download the SVG]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2024-w8bh-case.svg).

[1] I can't link to the project itself because it's a series of PDFs but it's
listed under the arduino projects menu.

Update March 2024: [Here is a 3D printed case which should fit](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5377530)

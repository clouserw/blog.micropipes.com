The Test Pilot team has been heads-down for months working on three new
experiments for Firefox and you can get them all today!

Min Vid
-------
[Min Vid][1] is an add-on that allows you to shrink a video into a small
always-on-top frame in the corner of your browser.  This lets you watch and
interact with a video while browsing the web in other tabs.  Opera and Safari
are implementing similar features so this one might have some sticking power.

Thanks to [Dave][2], [Jen][3], and [Jared][4] for taking this from some prototype code to in
front of Firefox users in six months.

Tracking Protection
-------------------
[Luke][5] has been working hard on [Tracking Protection][6] - an experiment
focused on collecting feedback from users about which sites break when Firefox
blocks the trackers from loading.  As we collect data from everyday users we can
make decisions about how best to block what people don't want and still show
them what they do.  Eventually this could lead to us protecting all Firefox
users with Tracking Protection by default.

Page Shot
---------
[Page Shot][7] is a snappy experiment that enables users to quickly take
screenshots in their browser and share them on the internet.  There are a few
companies in this space already, but their products always felt too heavy to me,
or they ignored privacy, or some simply didn't even work (this was on Linux).
Page Shot is light and quick and works great everywhere.

As a bonus, a feature I haven't seen anywhere else, Page Shot also offers
searching the text within the images themselves.  So if you take a screenshot of
a pizza recipe and later search for "mozzarella" it will find the recipe.

I was late to the Page Shot party and my involvement is just standing on the
shoulders of giants at this point: by the time I was involved the final touches
were already being put on.  A big thanks to [Ian][8] and [Donovan][9] for bringing
this project to life.

I called out the engineers who have been working to bring their creations to
life, but of course there are so many teams who were critical to today's
launches.  A big thank you to the people who have been working tirelessly and
congratulations on launching your products! :)

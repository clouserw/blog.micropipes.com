<p>Last year <a href="/blog/2011/03/29/welcome-to-the-landfill/">we set up landfill.amo</a> to give contributors an easy base to set up the addons.mozilla.org site.  Easy is relative here, of course, but it was a big leap over what we had at the time.</p>
<p><a href="http://farmdev.com/">Kumar</a> leapfrogged that milestone by adding <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> configuration scripts to our repository.  Now you can have a running version of AMO on your local system in about 3-5 commands[1].  </p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://mozilla.github.com/zamboni/topics/install-zamboni/install-with-vagrant.html">the steps to install AMO with Vagrant</a> to see how.  I set it up on OS X last week and aside from waiting for the download it only took a few minutes.  Drop by #amo on IRC if you run into any troubles.</p>
<p>[1]  Setting this up on Windows is apparently more difficult although one contributor did find success after fighting with it for some time.</p>
<p><em>Edit: Updated the installation instructions URL</em></p>

[Part 1: Identifying Priorities][1]

As promised, there is now a [public view of upcoming work on the Firefox
Marketplace][2].  This dashboard shows a rough representation of our thought
process when we evaluated each project using the criteria from [Part 1][3].  If
you hover over the titles there are also some helpful descriptions and questions
we asked ourselves.  Clicking a project title will expand to show some
information about the project as well as any notes about the scoring.  Some of
the projects have been grandfathered in to this process so they are a bit light
on details, but if you look at a project like <em>Support Low Memory Firefox OS
Devices (128MB)</em> you'll see the potential.

We're still working on the right people to get in the room to do the scoring.
Mailing lists are hard because of the lack of easy discussion but in person is
hard due to scheduling and not wasting time bikeshedding.  We'll get better as
we get experience, our main focus at this point is staying consistent with the
scoring - being sure to consider the entire ecosystem when assigning a value.

There are still a lot of projects to evaluate but I'm really excited about being
able to link to a backlog of projects and easily point out which are a high
priority and why.  As always, feedback welcome.

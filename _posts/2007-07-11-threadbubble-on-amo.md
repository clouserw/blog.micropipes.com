I submitted Threadbubble to [AMO][1] tonight.  I wanted to work out the bugs and
get it in a stable state before I put it on there and I think it's reached that
point.  Hosting it on AMO will prevent [potential security issues][2], and it
has the side benefit of providing automatic updates.

The [add-on is available][3], but it's currently in the sandbox (which means
you'll have to login if you want to see it).  If you already have an account,
feel free to add a review so I can get started on [the process][4] to get onto
the public side of AMO.

Once the add-on hits the public side, anyone with an older version will get
automatically updated which should help anyone experiencing the "disappearing
threads" from version 0.3.

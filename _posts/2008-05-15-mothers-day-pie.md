<p>Not that I need a special occasion to bake a tasty pie but mother's day
combined with picking 6 pounds of fresh rhubarb added up to a good excuse.</p>

<p>I puttered around on the internet looking for less ordinary recipes than what
I was used to and came up with an idea and a recipe.</p>

<p>The pie with the lattice top was a regular strawberry/rhubarb mix but I
stirred the fruit in a custard before adding it which made it richer with a hint
of nutmeg.</p>

<p>The pie in the background was a <a
href="http://www.rhubarbinfo.com/recipe-pie.html#index_pie_39">Rhubarb and
Pineapple Pie</a>.  There were four layers of fruit in the pie: two pineapple
and two rhubarb.  I thought it was a good combination, but really, we're talking
about butter, sugar, and fruit - how bad is it going to be? You could put
pomegranates and kiwis in there and it'd probably still taste great.</p>

<p>Oh, one more thing - what's the deal with tiny pies?  That recipe I linked to
calls for two cups of rhubarb and one cup of pineapple...really?  That's it?  If
I'm going to all the trouble to make pie crusts and bake a pie I'm going to fill
that bad boy up.  I put in around 5 cups of rhubarb and an entire pineapple.  Of
course, that meant a piece of the pie wasn't so much dessert as the whole
meal.</p>

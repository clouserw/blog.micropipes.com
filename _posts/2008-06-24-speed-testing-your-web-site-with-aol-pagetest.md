<p>I'm at <a
href="http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/content/home">Velocity 2008</a>
right now and the keynote I was most excited about this morning introduced <a
href="http://webpagetest.org/">http://webpagetest.org/</a>.</p>

<p>This site accepts a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> which
it loads over a network connection with the speed of your choice.  After loading
the site it offers you a waterfall graph of page elements, a screenshot so you
can see if it loaded correctly, and automatic comparisons to previous page loads
to see how caching affects your site.</p>

<p>The code behind the page is based on the open source <a
href="http://pagetest.sourceforge.net/">AOL Pagetest</a> which means it can be
modified as needed.  I think I heard <a
href="http://www.ryandoherty.net/">Ryan</a> say something about automated
testing over time with historical graphs and email alerts? :)</p>

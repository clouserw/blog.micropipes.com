I moved around a lot over the past year and ended up putting a bunch of old
t-shirts into a trunk and forgetting about them.  My one-o-clock-in-the-morning
brain decided now was a good time to go through the trunk and get rid of all
those old shirts I never wear.  It turns out we Mozillians used to really like
making t-shirts.  Below is a pile of shirts I found from around 2005-2011 or so.
How many can you identify?

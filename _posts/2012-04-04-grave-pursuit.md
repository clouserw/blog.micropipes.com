title: Grave Pursuit
---
<p>I read a book called <a href="http://www.robertswartwood.com/hint-fiction/">Hint Fiction</a> last year where the idea was to write a compelling story in 25 words or less.  My favorite that I can remember was by J. Matthew Zoss:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m sorry, but there’s not enough air in here for everyone. I’ll tell them you were a hero.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had an idea to translate this idea into photographs and tell a story within a limit of 3 photos (a generous 3000 words if we're going by the standard exchange).  I took the first two photos fairly quickly but the 3rd took me a long time to organize the scene (and get a participant).  During some time off a couple weeks ago I found the time to finish the trio of photos and complete the tale.</p>

[Check out Test Pilot][1] or read the [official announcement][2].

I joined the Test Pilot team in January and am pleased to be a part of launching
our experiment platform today on [testpilot.firefox.com][3]!  Our goal is to
provide a portal where you can easily browse and play with experimental features
in Firefox.

We're starting out with three new experiments so people can get a feel for what
the program is like and we'll be rotating new experiments in as previous ones
graduate from the program.

Behind the scenes is a [pretty comprehensive pipeline][4] to rocket an idea from the
back of a napkin to being used by users in a short period of time.  If you have
an idea (bonus points if it's already an add-on) and would like to get in the
program [let us know][5], look us up in #testpilot on irc.mozilla.org, or get in
touch with me directly.

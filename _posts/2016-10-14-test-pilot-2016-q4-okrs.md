The Test Pilot [2016 Q4 OKRs are published][1].  Primarily we'll be focused on
continued growth of users (our overall 2016 goal).  We deprioritized
localization last quarter and over-rotated on publishing experiments by
launching four when we were only aiming for one.  This quarter we'll turn that
knob back down (we're aiming for two new experiments) and get localization done.

We also failed to graduate any experiments last quarter -- arguably the most
important part of our entire process since it includes drawing conclusions and
publishing our results.  This quarter we'll graduate three experiments from Test
Pilot, publish our findings so we can improve Firefox, and clear out space in
Test Pilot for the next big ideas.

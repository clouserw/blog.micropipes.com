The situation had soured.  Tony Six and his goons had known I was coming for
four hours which means anyone that owed him a favor or had a score to settle
with me was already on their way and settling in to wait.  It wasn't the kind of
party I liked to crash but you don't always get to choose the venue.  I had one
ace they wouldn't be expecting.  They didn't know I'd have a train.

Mozilla24 is a worldwide conference about technology and the future of the
web.  I won't duplicate the about page, but check out the <a
href="http://www.mozilla24.com">line up of speakers</a>.

Whether you can attend in person or just visit online it should be able to
offer something for anyone interested in the open web.  If you've got some free
time at the end of this week, <a

<p>I'll be in Morocco at the end of next week and noticed there wasn't a single
<a href="http://mozillaparty.com">Mozilla Party</a> in the country!  There were
<a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord">over 36,000 download
pledges</a> though, so there must be Firefox supporters somewhere. :)</p>

<p>If you're in Morocco and want to meet up send me a message.  I'll see if I
can get <a href="http://chickswhoclick.wordpress.com/">Mary</a> to send me some
cool Firefox gear I can bring.</p>

I caught wind of a [Drupal meetup][1] tonight, and since I'm [going to be
working with Drupal in the near future][2] I thought I'd stop by and check it
out.  My main goal was to hear about other people's experiences using Drupal in
a multilingual environment.

This was my first time attending one of their meetings, but I think the turn out
was impressive for such an informal get-together (I'm guessing around thirty
people showed up).  There were several newcomers to Drupal that were just
wondering what the buzz was about and how it could make their lives easier.
After some introductions, the talk flowed mainly around nodes vs. pages, views
and <abbr title="Content Construction Kit">CCK</abbr>.  I think a lot of people
got their questions answered and got a jump start on their projects.

On the multilingual side of things, I was not so fortunate.  By the end of the
night, I didn't find anyone who was already using Drupal in more than one
language.  A couple people mentioned waiting for [Drupal 6][3] with it's pile of
<abbr title="Internationalization">i18n</abbr> additions, but that's not really
an option at this point since I need to get something up and working.  So, my
plan is still to stride boldly forward, armed with a list of modules people
mentioned (I'll post more on that once I have a chance to use them), and [my
newfound friend][4].

After the meeting was over, I lost track of time while meeting people and
sharing ideas.  Eventually our conversations migrated into the parking lot, and
we decided we should all go home and sleep before the sun started rising again.

Overall it was definitely worth going - I didn't learn what I went for, but I
got some good ideas (not just about Drupal!) and met a bunch of new people.  If
you're in the area and have an interest in Drupal, it's a great place to meet
others and see what kinds of things they're doing with it in the real world.
Thanks to [Sam Keen][5] for organizing and the [bus project][6] for providing
the meeting space.

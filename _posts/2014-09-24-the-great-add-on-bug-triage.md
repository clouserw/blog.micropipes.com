title: The Great Add-on Bug Triage
tags:

The AMO team is meeting this week to discuss road maps and strategies and
among the topics is our backlog of open bugs.  Since mid-2011 there has averaged
around 1200 bugs open at any one time.

Currently any interaction with AMO's bugs is too time consuming:  finding
good first bugs, triaging existing bugs, organizing a chunk of bugs to fix in a
milestone -- they all require interacting with a list of 1200 bugs, many of
which are years old and full of discussions by people who no longer contribute
to the bugs.  The small chunks of time I (and others) get to work on AMO are
consumed by digging through these old bugs and trying to apply them to the
current site.

In an effort to get this list to a manageable size the AMO team is aggressively
triaging and closing bugs this week, hopefully ending the week with a realistic
list of items we can hope to accomplish.  With that list in hand we can
prioritize the bugs, divide them into milestones, and begin to lobby for
developer time.

Many of the bugs which are being closed are good ideas and we'd like to fix
them, but we simply need to be realistic about what we can actually do with the
resources we have.  If you contribute patches to any of the bugs, please feel
free to reopen them.

Thanks for being a part of AMO.

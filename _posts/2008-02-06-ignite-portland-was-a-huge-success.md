title: Ignite Portland was a huge success
---
<p>I took the afternoon off work so I could drive to Portland to attend <a
href="http://www.igniteportland.com/">Ignite Portland</a>.  The introduction
didn't start until 6:20pm - I drove past the theatre at 4:45pm and there was
already a line.  The 500 person seating limit was filled while there were still
people waiting in line.  I slipped in with the 250 people that were allowed to
stand around the edges before they had to start turning people away.</p>

<p>Overall it was a pretty fun night.  The <a
href="http://www.igniteportland.com/agenda-presentations/">presentations</a>
were fantastic and, in true open source spirit, videos of them all will be
hitting youtube shortly.  Hopefully they'll find a bigger venue next time
because I've got a feeling attendance is just going to go up.  I'm sure more
details will be hitting the web shortly - search for "igniteportland" on your
favorite site that uses tags to get the content.</p>

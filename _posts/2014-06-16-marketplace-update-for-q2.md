title: Marketplace Update for Q2
tags:

Every quarter the apps team gets together to meet people and talk about all
the pieces of the projects.  This quarter we're doing a little different format
which I think will turn out to be a lot more social and hopefully keep things
interesting.  As part of the project I put together this short video talking
about Q2 for the Marketplace.  Thanks to all the developers working on the
Marketplace, Andy McKay for the payments videos, and Katt Taylor for helping
piece it together.

...and yeah, when I say "mammoth feat" I'm totally thinking of "mammoth feet."

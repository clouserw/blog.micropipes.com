title: Today, I clean my house beer-style
---
<p>I'm pretty sure I coined a new phrase in a dream last night.  In my dream, I was talking to some people about multitasking several projects that I had to do, and I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Nah, I'm going to do these projects beer-style."</p></blockquote>
<p>In the dream I specifically remember it meaning <em>"I'm going to finish one before starting another,"</em> and I think everyone I was talking to understood that.  I'm sure that was merely a consequence of my dream, but I'm going to try to weasel it into a real conversation soon and see if anyone notices.  If nothing else, I'll see if anyone is listening to me. :)</p>

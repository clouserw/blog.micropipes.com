Thirteen years ago I wrote [a library called Hera]({% link
_posts/2010-03-23-libraries-to-connect-to-a-citrix-netscaler-or-zeus-traffic-manager.md
%}) to make expiring content on Zeus Traffic Managers easier.  It was on PyPi
but never super popular and the maintainers of [Hera
Workflow](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/hera) got in touch with
me about taking over the namespace.  I don't use the library anymore so it was
easy to give up the name.  If you do need the library you can find it [on
GitHub](https://github.com/clouserw/hera).

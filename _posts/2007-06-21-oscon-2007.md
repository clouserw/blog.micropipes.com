I just learned recently that I'll be presenting at [OSCON 2007][1].  [Mike
Morgan][2] and I will be talking about the process we went through to localize
[addons.mozilla.org][3].

If you followed the saga when we were trying to launch, you know we ran into
some headaches with scaling the code to the amount of traffic that goes to the
site.  I've already written about [building a localizable site with CakePHP][4]
(and then wrote [some more][5], and a [little more][6]), but I don't think we'll
have time to get into the details like that.  I expect this will probably be a
higher level discussion, more about concepts and what we tried that didn't work.

You can read the [full description][7] if you're interested, although I don't
think we're going to be able to cover all that in the 45 minutes.  If you have
anything you want me to cover for sure, let me know; and if you're going to be
at OSCON, feel free to drop by.

title: My Homemade Vanilla Extract

<img src="/blog/public/img/vanilla_extract.jpg" alt="Bottled vanilla extract" />

I haven't found much time for cooking lately but this project brought me back to
the kitchen tonight.  I've been acquiring the ingredients for about a month and
finally found a suitable bottle (it was originally a bottle of MÃ¶nchshof World
Classic Schwarz).  I followed <a
href="http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Vanilla-Extraction/?ALLSTEPS">these
instructions</a> for the most part but I added a tablespoon of dark rum for
additional flavor.

The site claims the vanilla can be used as soon as a month but I expect to
filter it around September and then transfer it to smaller bottles.  All in all
I should get about a cup and a half of extract.  I hope it's as delicious as it
smells. :)

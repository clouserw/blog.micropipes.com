<p>Building off the success and fun that was had with the <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/tcontest">Firefox 3 T-Shirt Design Contest</a> Mozilla has just launched a new <a href="http://communitystore.mozilla.org/">Community Store</a>.</p>
<p>This store will let anyone upload shirt designs and print custom Mozilla shirts.  If you've got good taste but designing isn't up your alley you're welcome to browse and customize the existing designs as well.</p>
<p>I don't think there are any localized shirts on the site yet but I'm sure they'll start popping up soon - and once one is designed anyone in your local community can order it.  Zazzle, the company we're using, says <a href="http://zazzle.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/zazzle.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=453">they ship to 84 countries</a> which isn't everyone but it's a good start.</p>
<p>I'm excited that localized shirts are finally available and I'm looking forward to some great designs.</p>
